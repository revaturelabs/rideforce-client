            <br>
            <span>If you wish to see the profile page of a driver/passenger, simply click on the pin you wish to view.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>A user is able to save "favorite locations" associated with their account.</span>
            <br>
            <span>This way, they do not have constantly type in the same address for frequently visited locations.</span>
            <br>
            <span>In order to do so, the user will type in the address in question in the first text box on the map
              location
              after clicking the "Favorite Locations" tab.</span>
            <br>
            <span>The second text box is the name you wish to save the address as. For example, we can save
              Washington, DC
              as DC.</span>
            <br>
            <span>We then can use this saved name to type in to the third input box which will remove the location if

            <span>To browse potential drivers, once logged in click "Browse" on the navigation bar.</span>
            <br>
            <span>This will bring you to a view displaying a potential driver.</span>
            <br>
            <span>After viewing the potential driver's profile, if you think they are a good match, then "like" them as
              a
              potential driver.</span>
            <br>
            <span>If you think they are not a good match, simply "dislike" them and move on to the next.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Once a driver is "liked or "disliked", the next driver is immediately shown and the process
              repeats.</span>
            <br>
            <span>The order of drivers is determined by distance, so closer drivers will appear first on your browse
              page.</span>
            <br>
            <span>You can view all of the potential drivers that you have "liked" by viewing your "liked list"</span>
            <br>
            <span>Within this "liked list" you can once again view your "liked" drivers profiles.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Within their profile is their contact information, so simply reach out to them with whichever
              messaging
              service they have listed and hopefully it's a good match!</span>
