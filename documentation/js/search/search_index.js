generated with Angular CLI version 1.7.0.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server.

If you do not follow all these steps, there\nmay be problems!\ngit checkout -b your-branch # Omit the '-b' if the branch already exists.\n# Make changes to branch...\ngit add .  # Assuming you are in the root directory.\ngit commit -m 'Descriptive commit message'\ngit push -u origin your-branch # You can use just 'git push' if you've already pushed.Before you make a pull request, it's a good idea to merge any new changes\nfrom the dev branch, especially if you've spent a decent amount of time on\nyour changes (making it more likely that the dev branch has changed). This is\nthe best way to detect merge conflicts early.\n# To merge any new changes from the dev branch:\ngit checkout dev\ngit pull\ngit checkout your-branch\ngit merge devIf you get any merge conflicts, resolve them and then make a new commit (git add . && git commit -m 'Descriptive commit message).\nOnce you've pushed your branch, make a pull request on GitHub and make sure\nthat your PR is based off the dev branch and not master!\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
