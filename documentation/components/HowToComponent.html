      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Registering an Account:&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;To register a new account click &quot;Get Started&quot; on the main home page or &quot;Login&quot; on the navbar and then &quot;Register&quot; underneath the input fields.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Create Profile:&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Creating your profile is the first part of the process for registering a new account.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;This section requires you to input a variety of information:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Your first name&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Last name&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Username&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Password&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Confirm Password&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Key: Allows access to RideForce given to you by your instructor&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Office Address&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Apartment Address&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Batch End Date: Instructor should also notify you on your batch end date&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once all of this information is entered, you may move on to the &quot;Biography&quot; section, by clicking the &quot;Next&quot; button.
        &lt;h4&gt;Biography:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The &quot;Biography&quot; section requires some more information from you with a little more effort on detail:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;About You: Here you can enter some details about yourself so your fellow employees can see if you are a good potential
            fit as a passenger or driver.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Contact Info: This is where you enter your contact information, click the &quot;+&quot; button to add a new contact option. There are seven main types you may select from: Phone number, Email, Slack, Skype,
            Discord, GroupMe, and other potential services of your choosing.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you are done with required information within this section, you can move on to the &quot;Car Info&quot; section, by clicking
          on the &quot;Next&quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Car Info:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Within this section there are three options: Car, Passenger, or Both.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;If you do not have a car and plan on only being passenger, simply click next and move on to the next section.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;If you have a car and plan on being a driver, click the &quot;Car Info&quot; button and fill out the required input fields:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Make: Enter the brand of your vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Model: Enter model of your vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Year: Enter year of your vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Later on, if you want to set yourself as inactive, you can do so in the profile edit page in the navbar at the top.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once all required information is entered depending on the option chose, move on to the final section by clicking the
          &quot;Next&quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Review and Submit:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;You are now finished entering all required information and may review what you have entered thus far within this section.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;If some of the information is incorrect, you may go back to previous sections by clicking the respective number and re-enter what is incorrect.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Once the information looks good, give it one more look and then click &quot;Submit&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Congratulations! You have successfuly registered a new account and can login and start ridesharing with your new employees!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Login:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;In order to login, you must have a registered account. If you haven&#x27;t registered one yet, please refer to the &quot;Registering Account&quot; section above.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;To login, simply click &quot;Login&quot; on the navigation bar.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;You should now see the login view, which contains two input fields: &quot;Username&quot; and &quot;Password&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Simply enter in your registered account&#x27;s username and password into the respective input fields and click the big blue &quot;Login&quot; button underneath them.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Map:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;To view nearby addresses of current drivers and passengers, login and click &quot;Map&quot; on the navigation bar.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;After clicking &quot;Map&quot;, you will now see a map focused on your location and pins within the map showing nearby driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s addresses.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;If you wish to see the profile page of a driver/passenger, simply click on the pin you wish to view.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;A user is able to save &quot;favorite locations&quot; associated with their account.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;This way, they do not have constantly type in the same address for frequently visited locations.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;In order to do so, the user will type in the address in question in the first text box on the map location after clicking the &quot;Favorite Locations&quot; tab.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The second text box is the name you wish to save the address as. For example, we can save Washingston, DC as DC.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;We then can use this saved name to type in to the third input box which will remove the location if need be.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Browse:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;To browse potential drivers, once logged in click &quot;Browse&quot; on the navigation bar.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;This will bring you to a view displaying a potential driver.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;After viewing the potential driver&#x27;s profile, if you think they are a good match, then &quot;like&quot; them as a potential driver.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;If you think they are not a good match, simply &quot;dislike&quot; them and move on to the next.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Once a a driver is &quot;liked or &quot;disliked&quot;, the next driver is immediately shown and the process repeats.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The order of drivers is determined by distance, so closer drivers will appear first on your browse page.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;You can view all of the potential drivers that you have &quot;liked&quot; by viewing your &quot;liked list&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Within this &quot;liked list&quot; you can once again view your &quot;liked&quot; drivers profiles.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Within their profile is their contact information, so simply reach out to them with whichever messaging service they have listed and hopefully it&#x27;s a good match!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;For the Admin/Trainer&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;You can click &quot;Get Key&quot; from the navbar which will take you to a page in which you fill out your batch end date and the location of the office.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Once the fields are filled, click the &quot;Get Key&quot; button to generate a key with the above information already included.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; After the key has been generated, send it to an associate of your batch so they may create an account and start swiping!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;An admin is able to make users into admins or trainers by going to the user profile and clicking on the &quot;View Users&quot; tab.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; Both an admin and a trainer can disable a user&#x27;s account.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt; This will prevent that particular user from logging in until the profile is enabled again.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
